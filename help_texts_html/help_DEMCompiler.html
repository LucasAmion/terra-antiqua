        The purpose of this tool is to create a raster that combines the topography and the bathymetry at a given time of reconstruction.
        This may be done differently depending on which files are available.
        
        You need three types of data:
        
        
        
        
        1) Bathymetry rasters
        
        
        Field - Paleoocean bathymetry raster: Select your bathymetry file, already reconstructed to the desired time (eg. Mueller et al. 2008).
        
        Field (optional) - Ocean age: If you have a present day ocean age raster, select it from the list  (it must be rotated to its position at the time of reconstruction)
        In this case you will have to specify the age of the reconstruction in the corresponding field.
        
        Field (optional) - Shallow sea bathymetry: If you have a present day shallow bathymetry raster, enter it too (rotated to its position at the time of reconstruction)
        In this case you will have to specify a maximum depth (in m) for the continental shelf.
        
        
        2) Topography raster
        
        
        Field - Bedrock topography: Enter the raster containing the topography.
        Note: You need the bedrock topography here.
        If you have data for the ice topography, you may perform an isostatic compensation using the “standard processing tools”.
        
        
        
        3) Masks
        
        Field - General masks: To perform the compilation you need a vector polygon layer with general masks covering the tectonic blocks.
        
        
        
        4) Field - Output file path: Specify an output directory and a file name.
