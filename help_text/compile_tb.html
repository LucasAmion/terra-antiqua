<p>
	The purpose of this tool is to create a raster that combines the topography and the bathymetry at a given time of reconstruction. This may be done differently depending on which files are available.

<p>
<div>The fields marked with a <b>*</b> are mandatory.</div>

<p>
    <h4>I- Masks</h4><br/>
<b>Field - <i>Continental Blocks</i></b><br/> To perform the compilation you need, within a layer, the set of vector polygons of the tectonic blocks rotated back to the time of reconstruction.
</p>

<p>
	 <h4> II- Topography raster</h4><br/>
     
     <b> Field - <i> Bedrock topography</i> </b><br/> Enter the raster containing the topography (ETOPO).<br/>
     <div>For ice sheets, you need the bedrock topography. If you have data for the ice topography, you may perform an isostatic compensation using the "standard processing tools".</div>
</p>
<p>
	<h4> III- Bathymetry rasters</h4><br/>

    
    <b>Field -<i> Reconstructed paleobathymetry</i> </b> <br/> Select your bathymetry file, already reconstructed to the desired time (eg. Mueller et al. 2008).<br/>
    <p>
    <div> If you select datasets for the optional fields below, they will be used to reconstruct the paleobathymetry, and the data from the raster entered as <i> reconstructed paleobathymetry</i> will only be used to fill in the gaps. Please refer to the manual for more info.</div>
    
    <b> Field (optional) - <i>Ocean age</i> </b><br/> If you have a present day ocean age raster, select it from the list.  It must be rotated to its position at the time of reconstruction.
   You will have to specify the age of the reconstruction (Ma) in the corresponding field. This will be used to calculate the paleobathymetry.<br/>
    
    <b> Field (optional) - <i>Shallow sea bathymetry</i> </b> <br/> If you have a present day shallow bathymetry raster, enter it here (rotated to its position at the time of reconstruction).
    You will have to specify a maximum depth (in m) for the continental shelf.
</p>

<p>
	<h4> Output</h4><br/>
    
    <b>Specify the <i>Output file path</i>.</b><br>
    If there is not a path specified here, the file will be created in the temporary folder. The full path will be shown in the <i>Log</i> tab and the result will be loaded to the map canvas.
    <div><b>Warnings:</b> <br>I) Please avoid using these characters in the file name, as they might cause processing errors: <i>( ) / - % $ @ #</i><br><br>
           II) If this tool is used repetitively with no path specified, previous results will be overwritten. To avoid this, specify a different path (or filename) each time</div>
