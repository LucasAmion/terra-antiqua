   <p> This tool is designed to reduce abrupt topography changes in a DEM. It is meant to be used while paleoreconstruction after interpolation or topography modification. However, it may be used in any topography raster.
   <p>
   <b>Field - <i>Select the compiled  topography+bathymetry raster</i></b><br/>You need to specify the raster where you want to perform the smoothing.
   <p><b>Field - <i>Soothing factor</i></b><br/>
   Enter here the number of cells that should be taken into account to calculate the smoothing.
   <p><div5>must still specify what exactly the smoothing does</div5>
