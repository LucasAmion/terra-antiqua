This tool is intended to perform an interpolation within a raster. Although it may be used to interpolate values in any raster, this tool is optimised to treat topography and it has been designed to make the result from previous tools appear more realistic.
Field - Select the compiled raster: Choose the raster where you want to perform the interpolation.

Field - Smooth resulting raster: If you tick this box the resulting raster will be smoothed. This means that the extreme values will be brought closer to the average. You may also specify a smoothing factor.

Field - Add the resulting raster to canvas: Tick this option to add the resulting raster to the canvas.
