        <b><i>How would you like to process the input DEM:</i></b><br/>
            Choose the processing tool you want to use.
            
   <p> <b>Smoothing</b> is designed to reduce abrupt elevation changes in a DEM. It is meant to be used after the
       primary tools in a map without gaps. 
    
    
   <p>
   <b><i>Raster to be modified:</i></b><br/>You need to choose a raster (DEM) where you want to perform the smoothing.
   <p>
   Check the option <b><i>Smooth inside polygon(s) only</i></b> to smooth only parts of the raster layer that are marked by the mask polygons.
   <p>

   <b><i>Mask layer:</i></b> <br/> Select a layer that contains mask polygons for smoothing. 

   <p>
       <b><i>Smoothing type:</i></b><br/>
       Select which filter will be used for the smoothing. Please refer to the manual for details about the different filters.
   <p>
   <b><i>Smoothing factor:</i></b><br/>

    Enter the smoothing factor this text field or, if it is in the attribute table (e.g.: itâ€™s different for each mask), please select the corresponding attribute field by pressing the override button on the right. <br/>
    This factor represents the radius around a given pixel that will be taken into consideration. The greater the number, the smoother will the resulting raster be.
<div>
       The <b><i>smoothing factor</i></b> specified in the text field will be used as default for the polygons that do not have an individual smoothing factor in the attribute table.</div>
    <div><a>More information in the User's Manual</a> </div>
   <p>
       <b><i>Advanced parameters:</i></b><br/>
       <b><i>Set Paleoshorelines fixed</i></b> can be checked to keep paleoshorelines fixed during smoothing. <br/><br/>
       <b><i>Rotated paleoshorelines:</i></b><br/>
       You need to select a vector layer containing paleoshoreline polygons. 

     

   <p>
   <b><i>Output file path:</i></b><br/>
   If there is no path specified here, the file will be created in the temporary folder. The full path will be shown in the <b>Log</b> tab and the result will be loaded to the map canvas.

   <div><b>Warning:</b> Please avoid using these characters in the file name, as they might cause processing errors: <i>( ) / - % $ @ #</i><br/>
       <b>Note:</b> If this tool is used repetitively with no path specified, previous results will be overwritten. To avoid this, specify a different path (or filename) each time.</div>
