            <b>Field - <i>How would you like to process the DEM</i></b>:<br/>
            Choose the processing tool you want to use.
            
   <p> This tool is designed to reduce abrupt elevation changes in a DEM. It is meant to be used after topography modification and interpolation. However, it may be used in any DEM raster (1 band).
   <p>
   <b>Field - <i>Raster to be modified (Input)</i></b><br/>You need to specify the raster (DEM) where you want to perform the smoothing.
   <p>
   <b>Field - <i>Smoothing factor</i></b>:<br/>
   You may specify a smoothing factor, which represents the radius around a given pixel that will be taken into consideration. The greater the factor the smoother will the resulting raster be.
      <div>Please be aware that smoothing may take 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the system. A higher smoothing factor will increase the processing time.</div>
   <p>
   <b>Specify the <i>Output file path</i>.</b><br>
   If there is no path specified here, the file will be created in the temporary folder. The full path will be shown in the <i>Log</i> tab and the result will be loaded to the map canvas.
   
   <div><b>Warnings:</b> <br>I) Please avoid using these characters in the file name, as they might cause processing errors: <i>( ) / - % $ @ #</i><br>
   II) If this tool is used repetitively with no path specified, previous results will be overwritten. To avoid this, specify a different path (or filename) each time</div>
