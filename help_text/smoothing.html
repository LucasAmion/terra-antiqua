        <b><i>How would you like to process the input DEM:</i></b><br/>
            Choose the processing tool you want to use.
            
   <p> <b>Smoothing</b> is designed to reduce abrupt elevation changes in a DEM. It is meant to be used after the
       primary tools in a map without gaps. 
    
    <!-- this technical info belongs to the manual. This algorithms handles the boundaries automatically: if the raster covers
       the entire globe, the raster is wrapped around to the opposite side. -->
   <p>
   <b><i>Raster to be modified:</i></b><br/>You need to choose a raster (DEM) where you want to perform the smoothing.
   <p>
   Check the option <b><i>Smooth inside polygon(s) only</i></b> to smooth only parts of the raster layer that are marked by the mask polygons.
   <p>
   <b><i>Mask layer:</i></b> <br/> Select a layer that contains mask polygons for smoothing. 
   <p>
       <b><i>Smoothing type:</i></b><br>
   Select a Smoothing type: Gaussian filter or Uniform filter. Please refer to the manual for details about these.
   <p>
   <b><i>Smoothing factor:</i></b><br/>
   You may specify a smoothing factor, which represents the radius around a given pixel that will be taken into consideration. The greater the factor, the smoother will the resulting raster be.
    This factor will be 
   <div>Please be aware that a higher smoothing factor will increase the processing time.</div> <br/>
     
      <div>If you have different smoothing factors for each polygon, select the corresponding field from the attribute
    table using the override button on the right.<br/>
       The <b>smoothing factor<b> specified above will be used as default for the polygons that do not have an individual smoothing factor on the attribute table.</div>

   <b><i>Output file path:</i></b><br/>
   If there is no path specified here, the file will be created in the temporary folder. The full path will be shown in the <b>Log</b> tab and the result will be loaded to the map canvas.

   <div><b>Warning:</b> Please avoid using these characters in the file name, as they might cause processing errors: <i>( ) / - % $ @ #</i><br/>
       <b>Note:</b> If this tool is used repetitively with no path specified, previous results will be overwritten. To avoid this, specify a different path (or filename) each time.</div>
