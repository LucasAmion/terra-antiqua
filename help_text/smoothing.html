        <p>
        <b><i>How would you like to process the input DEM:</i></b><br/>
            Choose the processing tool you want to use.
            
   <p> <b>Smoothing</b> is designed to reduce abrupt elevation changes in a DEM. It is meant to be used after the
       primary tools in a map without gaps. This algorithms handles the boundaries automatically: if the raster covers
       the entire globe, the raster is wrapped around to the opposite side. 
   <p>
   <b><i>Raster to be modified:</i></b><br/>You need to choose a raster (DEM) where you want to perform the smoothing.
   <p>
   <b><i>Smooth inside polygon(s) only</i></b> can be checked to smooth only parts of the raster layer that are
   highlighted by the mask polygons.
   <p>
   <b><i>Mask layer:</i></b> <br/> Select a layer that contains mask polygons for smoothing. This layer can have
       smoothing factor in the attribute table that can be used for smoothing parts of the raster layer with different smoothing factors.
   <p>
       <b><i>Smoothing type:</i></b><br>
   Select a Smoothing type: Gaussian filter or Uniform filter. Please refer to the manual for details about these.
   <p>
   <b><i>Smoothing factor:</i></b><br/>
   You may specify a smoothing factor, which represents the radius around a given pixel that will be taken into consideration. The greater the factor, the smoother will the resulting raster be.
   <div>Please be aware that a higher smoothing factor will increase the processing time.</div> <br/>
      <div>Smoothing factor can also be retrieved from the attribute table (in case if different parts of the raster are
          to be smoothed with a different smoothing factor). For this, you need to press the button from the right side
          of the smoothing factor field, then chose an appropriate field name under the menu "Field type:..." </div>
   <p>
       <b><i>Advanced parameters:</i></b><br/>
       <b><i>Set Paleoshorelines fixed</i></b> can be checked to keep paleoshorelines fixed during smoothing. <br/><br/>
       <b><i>Rotated paleoshorelines:</i></b><br/>
       You need to select a vector layer containing paleoshoreline polygons. 
     

   <p>
   <b><i>Output file path:</i></b><br/>
   If there is no path specified here, the file will be created in the temporary folder. The full path will be shown in the <b>Log</b> tab and the result will be loaded to the map canvas.

   <div><b>Warning:</b> Please avoid using these characters in the file name, as they might cause processing errors: <i>( ) / - % $ @ #</i><br/>
       <b>Note:</b> If this tool is used repetitively with no path specified, previous results will be overwritten. To avoid this, specify a different path (or filename) each time</div>
