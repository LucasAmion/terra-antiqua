This tool integrates the paleoshorelines into the DEM compiling the topography and bathymetry. Based on the mask provided, it will be checked if regions that should be emerged appear underwater and if submerged regions are shown above the sea level. The resulting raster will include these corrections by giving the value <i>1</i> to the newly emerged areas and <i>-100</i> to the newly submerged areas.
<p>
<b>Field - <i>Topography raster</b></i>:<br/> Select the raster compiling the topography and the bathymetry (rotated to the time of reconstruction)
<p>
<b>Field - <i>Shorelines</b></i>:<br/> Select the vector layer with the paleoshorelines (rotated to the time of reconstruction).
