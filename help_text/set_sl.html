            <b><i>How would you like to process the DEM</i></b>:<br/>
            Choose the processing tool you want to use.
<p>
This tool sets a new sea level by shifting the elevation values vertically by the 
amount specified. 

<p><b><i>Raster to be modified </i></b><br/>
Select a raster layer, on which a new sea level shoud be set. 

<p>The <b><i>amount of sea level shift</i></b> parameter  defines the amount of the 
    sea level vertical shift relative to its present day level.
    For example, if the sea level should be dropped by 100 meters this parameter 
    should set a value of -100 m. In this case the topography will get higher by 
    100 m and the bathymetry will shallower by this same amount
<p>
<b>Specify the <i>Output file path</i>.</b><br>
If there is no path specified here, the file will be created in the temporary folder. 
The full path will be shown in the <i>Log</i> tab and the result will be loaded to 
the map canvas.

<div><b>Warnings:</b> <br>I) Please avoid using these characters in the file name, 
    as they might cause processing errors: <i>( ) / - % $ @ #</i><br>
<b>Note:</b>If this tool is used repetitively with no path specified, previous 
results will be overwritten. To avoid this, specify a different path (or filename) 
each time</div>
