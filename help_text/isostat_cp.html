            <b><i>How would you like to process the DEM</i></b>:<br/>
            Choose the processing tool you want to use.
<p>
This tool compensates for the load of ice mass on continental crust 
(such as on Antarctica). For this purpose  the tool calculates elevation 
difference between bedrock and ice topogrpahy rasters (Ice thickness). 
After that the bedrock topogrpahy is emerged as follows: 
<p>
<b>Hc = Hi+0.3*Hd*Ir</b>
<p>
    Where:<br/>
<i><b>Hc</b> - Compensated elevation</i> <br/>
<i><b>Hi</b> - Initial elevation</i><br/>
<i><b>Hd</b> - Elevation difference between the bedrock and ice topographies</i><br/>
<i><b>Ir</b> - The ice amount to be removed (in %)</i>

<p><b><i>Raster to be modified </i></b><br/>
Select a raster corresponding to the bedrock topography (topography and bathymetry 
DEM compiled and rotated to the time of reconstruction).

<p><b><i>Ice topography raster</i></b><br/>
Select a raster corresponding to the ice topography (rotated to the time of reconstruction).

<p><b><i>Mask layer</i></b><br/>
Select a mask layer that contains polygon masks defining the areas to be compensated 
for the ice load. <br/>

<div>If you select the option <b><i>Get polar regions automatically</i></b>, common 
    names for polar plates (Antarctica, Greenland, etc...) will be searched among 
    the masks of continental blocks and those polygons will be used for the
    isostatic compensation. In this case, you have to select the vector file 
    containing the continental blocks in the field <b><i>Mask layer</i></b>. 
    Make sure you have an attribute field called NAME and that it is populated 
    with the name of tectonic blocks. </br>In the <i>Log</i> tab, you can see the 
    full list of polar plate names that the algorithm recognizes.</div>

<p>The <b><i>amount of ice to be removed</i></b> parameter does what it says -
    defines the amount of ice to be removed.  The higher the percentage, the 
    higher the resulting topography will be.
<p>
<b>Specify the <i>Output file path</i>.</b><br>
If there is no path specified here, the file will be created in the temporary folder. 
The full path will be shown in the <i>Log</i> tab and the result will be loaded to 
the map canvas.

<div><b>Warnings:</b> <br>I) Please avoid using these characters in the file name, 
    as they might cause processing errors: <i>( ) / - % $ @ #</i><br>
<b>Note:</b>If this tool is used repetitively with no path specified, previous 
results will be overwritten. To avoid this, specify a different path (or filename) 
each time</div>
