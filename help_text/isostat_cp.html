            <b><i>How would you like to process the DEM:</i></b><br/>
            Choose the processing tool you want to use.
<p>

This tool compensates for the absence of ice mass in the poles. The DEM values will be modified in the areas where there is a difference between ice and bedrock topography. Present-day ice and  bedrock topography are used to calculate the thickness of present-day ice covering Antarctic and Greenland. The thickness is determined by subtracting the bedrock topography from ice topography. Then that topography is raised according to following formula:


<p>
<i>Hc = Hi+0.3*Hd*Ir</i>
<p>
    Where:<br/>
<i>Hc</i> - Compensated elevation (new elevation value) <br/>
<i>Hi</i> - Initial elevation<br/>
<i>Hd</i> - Elevation difference between the bedrock and ice topographies (ice thickness)<br/>
<i>Ir</i> - Removed amount of ice (in %)

<p><b><i>Raster to be modified </i></b><br/>
Select a raster corresponding to the bedrock topography (topography and bathymetry 
DEM compiled and rotated to the time of reconstruction).

<p><b><i>Ice topography raster</i></b><br/>
Select a raster corresponding to the ice topography (rotated to the time of reconstruction).

<p><b><i>Mask layer</i></b><br/>
Select a mask layer that contains polygon masks defining the areas to be compensated 
for the ice load. <br/>

<div>If you select the option <b><i>Get polar regions automatically</i></b>, common 
    names for polar plates (Antarctica, Greenland, etc...) will be searched among 
    the masks of continental blocks and those polygons will be used for the
    isostatic compensation. In this case, you have to select the vector file 
    containing the continental blocks in the field <b>Mask layer</b>.
    Make sure you have an attribute field called NAME and that it is populated 
    with the name of tectonic blocks. <br/>Please refer to the manual for the
    full list of polar plate names that the algorithm recognizes.</div>

<p><b><i>Amount of ice to be removed:</i></b><br/>
    If you enter <i>100%</i>, the isostatic rebound will be calculated assuming all the ice dissapears from the poles. With a lower percentage, the isostatic rebound will be smaller and the bedrock topography will be lower.
<p>
<b><i>Output file path:</i></b><br/>
If there is no path specified here, the file will be created in the temporary folder. The full path will be shown in the <b>Log</b> tab and the result will be loaded to the map canvas.

<div><b>Warning:</b> Please avoid using these characters in the file name, as they might cause processing errors: <i>( ) / - % $ @ #</i><br/>
    <b>Note:</b> If this tool is used repetitively with no path specified, previous results will be overwritten. To avoid this, specify a different path (or filename) each time</div>
