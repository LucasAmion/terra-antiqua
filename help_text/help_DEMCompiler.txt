The purpose of this tool is to create a raster that unifies the topography and the bathymetry at a given time of reconstruction.
This may be done differently depending on which files are available.

You need three types of data: 




1) Bathymetry rasters


In the field “Paleoocean bathymetry raster”, you must select your bathymetry file, already reconstructed to the desired time.

(optional) If you have a present day ocean age raster, select it from the list  (it must be rotated to its position at the time of reconstruction)
	In this case you will have to specify the age of the reconstruction in the corresponding field

(optional) If you have a present day shallow bathymetry raster, enter it too (rotated to its position at the time of reconstruction)
	In this case you will have to specify a maximum depth (in m) for the continental shelf


2) Topography raster


In the field “Bedrock topography” you must enter the raster containing the topography.
Note that you need the bedrock topography here.
If you have data for the ice topography, you may perform an isostatic compensation using the “standard processing tools”.



3) Masks


To perform the compilation you need a vector polygon layer with general masks covering the tectonic blocks. This must be entered in the corresponding field.


4) Finally specify an output directory and a file name.
