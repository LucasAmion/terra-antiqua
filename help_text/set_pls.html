    <title> Set Paleoshorelines </title>
    <body>
    <p>
    This tool performs a correction to the compiled DEM (topography and bathymetry) according to the provided paleoshoreline polygons.<br/>
    It will emerge regions that should be emerged but appear underwater. Conversely, it submerges regions that should be submerged but are shown above the sea level.

<p>
<b>Field - <i>Raster to be modified (Input)</b></i>:<br/> Select the raster (DEM) compiling the topography and the bathymetry (rotated to the time of reconstruction)
<p>
<b>Field - <i>Rotated Paleoshorelines</b></i>:<br/> Select the vector layer with the paleoshorelines rotated to the time of reconstruction (to get or modify paleoshorelines, see the manual).
<p> <b>Field - <i>Modification mode</b></i>:<br/>
If you select <i><b>Interpolation</b></i>, elevation values of the areas to be emerged or submerged are erased and these gaps subsequently interpolated.<br/>
If you select <i><b>Rescaling</b></i>, the originally submerged values are linearly rescaled between <i>0.1</i> and the elevation you enter. For the newly submerged areas, the originally emerged values are linearly rescaled between <i>-0.1</i> and the depth you enter.
 <div>For more information, please refer to the manual</div>
<p>
<b>Field - <i>Maximum elevation of the emerged area</b></i>:<br/> Enter the chosen maximum elevation for the newly emerged areas in m (default = 2.0m). This is only available for the <I>Rescaling</i> modification mode.
<p>
<b>Field - <i>Maximum depth of the submerged area</b></i>:<br/>
Enter the chosen maximum depth for the newly submerged area in m (default = -5.0m). This must be a negative value since it's related to bathymetry. This is only available for the <i>Rescaling</i> modification mode.
<p>
<b>Specify the <i>Output file path</i>.</b><br>
If there is no path specified here, the file will be created in the temporary folder. The full path will be shown in the <i>Log</i> tab and the result will be loaded to the map canvas.
<div><b>Warnings:</b> <br>I) Please avoid using these characters in the file name, as they might cause processing errors: <i>( ) / - % $ @ #</i><br>
II) If this tool is used repetitively with no path specified, previous results will be overwritten. To avoid this, specify a different path (or filename) each time</div>
