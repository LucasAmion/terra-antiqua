<body>
  <p>
    This tool will allow you to reconstruct present day vector layers to a specific reconstruction
    time applying particular rotation model, using the <b>pyGPlates</b> library.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Input Layer:</b> The input layer can be downloaded from the GPlates repository, which includes
    different types of vector layer such as <b>Static Polygons, Continental-Ocean Boundaries (COBs),
    Coastlines</b>, etc. Since these files are associated with a particular rotation model, depending on
    the type of layer selected, not all rotation models might be available. You can also use a local
    vector layer that is already added to the project or a file in Shapefile format (.shp) in your
    computer as input.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Rotation Model:</b> The rotation models available will depend on the type of vector layer selected.
    They will be downloaded from the <b>GPlates repository</b> (see https://gwsdoc.gplates.org/models for
    more information) into the user's data directory (<i>C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Local
    \QGIS\QGIS3\plugins\terra_antiqua\models\{MODEL_NAME}</i> on Windows or <i>/home/{USER}/
    .local/share/QGIS3/plugins/terra_antiqua/models/{MODEL_NAME}</i> on Unix based systems).
    The downloaded files will include the rotation file itself (.rot format), as well as the vector layer
    associated with it.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Reconstruction time:</b> The time for the output layer to be generated in Ma (millions
    of years ago).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b><i>Output file path:</i></b><br/>
    If there is no path specified here, the file will be created in the temporary folder. The full path
    will be shown in the <b>Log</b> tab and the result will be loaded to the map canvas.

      <b>Warning:</b> Please avoid using these characters in the file name, as they might cause
      processing errors: <i>( ) / - % $ @ #</i><br/>
      <b>Note:</b> If this tool is used repetitively with no path specified, previous results will
      be overwritten. To avoid this, specify a different path (or filename) each time
