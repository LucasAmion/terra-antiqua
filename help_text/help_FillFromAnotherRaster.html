    <title> Fill from another raster </title>
    <body>
<p> This tool allows you to copy values from a raster into another one. The values of the pixels covered by the masks selected will be copied into the second raster.
<div>Although <i>Fill from another raster</i> has been designed as a complementary tool for the DEM compiler, it may be used with any single band raster. </div>
<p>
<b>Field - <i>Compiled raster (DEM)</i></b><br/>

<br/><b>Field - <i>Masks</i></b><br/>
