<title> Create Topography / Bathymetry </title>

<body>
<p>
This tool creates new topography or bathymetry in a DEM in the area defined by a polygon.

<p>
<b><i>Raster to be modified</i>:</b><br/>
Select a raster layer, in which you want to create the features.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Layer with feature polygons</i>:</b><br/>
Select a vector layer containing the polygons where you want to create new geographic features.
If only certain masks should be used for feature creation, these masks must be selected and then the <i><b>Selected
        features only</i></b> must be checked.
</p>
<p><b><i>Geographic feature type:</i>:</b><br/>
Select the type of the geographic feature that you want to create (ocean, mountain range). 
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Maximum sea depth / ridge elevation (in m)</i>:</b><br/>
Enter here the maximum elevation (for topography) or depth (for bathymetry) that the new features must have.
<br/>
<b>Note:</b> All the parameters defining the geometry of the feature to be created (max depth, min depth etc.) can be
selected from the attribute table (if the parameters are different for each feature). To this end, a field should be
specified in the menu by pressing the button on the right side of each field.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Minimum sea depth / ridge elevation (in m)</i>:</b><br/>
Enter here the minimum elevation (for topography) or depth (for bathymetry) that the new features must have.
</p>
<p>
<b> <i>Ruggedness of the mountains (in %)</i>:</b><br/>
<i>(only available for mountains)</i> The lower this value, the "smoother" will the mountain be.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Shelf width (in km)</i>:</b><br/>
<i>(only available for seas)</i> Enter here the width of the shallow sea area that will be created at the margins of the
sea (continental shelf).
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Width of the continental slope</i>:</b><br/>
<i>(only available for seas)</i> Enter here how large you want to make the contiental slope, which will start at the end of the shelf you define above. The higher this number is, the flatter will the slope be.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Width of the mountain slope</i>:</b><br/>
<i>(only available for mountains)</i> Enter here how large you want to make the mountain slope, which will start from
the edge of the polygon (toward the center). The higher this number is, the flatter will the slope be.
</p>
<p>
<b>Specify the <i>Output file path</i>.</b><br>
If there is no path specified here, the file will be created in the temporary folder. The full path will be shown in the <i>Log</i> tab and the result will be loaded to the map canvas.

<div><b>Warnings:</b> <br>I) Please avoid using these characters in the file name, as they might cause processing errors: <i>( ) / - % $ @ #</i><br>
    <b><i>Note:</i></b>If this tool is used repetitively with no path specified, previous results will be overwritten. To avoid this, specify a different path (or filename) each time</div>
