<title> Create Topography / Bathymetry </title>

<body>
<p>
This tool creates new topography or bathymetry in a DEM in the area defined by a polygon.

<p>
<h4>Geographic feature creation</h4><br/>
<b>Field - <i>Geographic feature type</i>:</b><br/>
Select whether you want to create an ocean or a mountain range. For details about the way these are created, please refer to the manual.
<b>Field - <i>Raster to be modified</i>:</b><br/>
Select the raster where you want to create the features.
<p>
<b>Field - <i>Layer with polygons for the geographic features</i>:</b><br/>
Select the vector file containing the polygons where you want to create new geographic features.
<p>
<b>Field - <i>Maximum sea depth / ridge elevation (in m)</i>:</b><br/>
Enter here the maximum elevation (for topography) or depth (for bathymetry) that the new features must have.
<p>
<b>Field - <i>Minimum sea depth / ridge elevation (in m)</i>:</b><br/>
Enter here the minimum elevation (for topography) or depth (for bathymetry) that the new features must have.
<p>
<b>Field - <i>Ruggedness of the mountains (in %)</i>:</b><br/>
<i>(only available for mountains)</i> The lower this percentage, the "smoother" will the mountain be.
<p>
<b>Field - <i>Shelf width (in km)</i>:</b><br/>
<i>(only available for seas)</i> Enter here the width of the shallow sea area that will be created at the margins of the sea.
<p>
<b>Field - <i>Width of the continental slope</i>:</b><br/>
<i>(only available for seas)</i> Enter here how large you want to make the contiental slope, which will start at the end of the shelf you define above. The higher this number is, the flatter will the slope be.
<p>
<b>Field - <i>Width of the mountain slope</i>:</b><br/>
<i>(only available for mountains)</i> Enter here how large you want to make the mountain slope, which will start from the edge of the polygon. The higher this number is, the flatter will the slope be.
<p>
<b>Specify the <i>Output file path</i>.</b><br>
If there is not a path specified here, the file will be created in the temporary folder. The full path will be shown in the <i>Log</i> tab and the result will be loaded to the map canvas.

<div><b>Warnings:</b> <br>I) Please avoid using these characters in the file name, as they might cause processing errors: <i>( ) / - % $ @ #</i><br>
II) If this tool is used repetitively with no path specified, previous results will be overwritten. To avoid this, specify a different path (or filename) each time</div>
    <p>Note: This tool is beeing redesigned for v0.3 of Terra Antiqua</p>
