  <p>
    This tool allows you to download present day raster using <b>PlateModelManager</b>
    and reconstruct them to a desired age.

  <p>
    You can choose a <b>rotation model</b> and a time for the reconstruction (in Millions of years),
    and the map will be modified using the <b>GPlately</b> library.
