        <b><i>How would you like to process the DEM</i></b>:<br/>
        Choose the processing tool you want to use.
        <p>
<i>Fill gaps</i> is intended to interpolate values for gaps between rotated tectonic blocks. It generates elevation data
in each empty pixel by interpolatinf from pixel values around it, using inverse distance weighting. 
<p>
<b><i>Raster to be modified (Input)</i></b>:<br/> Choose the raster (topography and bathymetry DEM) where you want to perform the interpolation.

<br>If you check <i><b>Interpolate inside polygons</b></i> checkbox, the interpolation will be constrained to the <i><b>masks</b></i> you select. </div>
<p>
<b><i>Smooth resulting raster</i></b>:<br/>
Checking this checkbox will smooth the resulting raster. This means that the sharp edges will be less pronounced.<br/>
For now two different <b><i>Smoothing types</i></b> are available: Gaussian filter and Uniform filter. 
<br/>You may also specify a <b><i>smoothing factor</i></b>, which represents the radius around a given pixel that will
be taken into consideration. <br/>The higher the factor, the smoother will the resulting raster be.
<div> Please be aware that smoothing may take 5 to 10 minutes, depending on the system. A higher smoothing factor will increase the processing time.</div>
<p>
<b>Specify the <i>Output file path</i>.</b><br>
If there is no path specified here, the output file will be created in the temporary folder. The full path will be shown in the <i>Log</i> tab and the result will be loaded to the map canvas.

<div><b>Warnings:</b> <br>I) Please avoid using these characters in the file name, as they might cause processing errors: <i>( ) / - % $ @ #</i><br>
    <b>Note:</b>If this tool is used repetitively with no path specified, previous results will be overwritten. To avoid
this, specify a different file path each time</div>
