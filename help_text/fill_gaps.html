        <b><i>How would you like to process the input DEM:</i></b><br/>
        Choose the processing tool you want to use.
        <p>
<b>Fill gaps</b> is intended to fill values for gaps between rotated tectonic blocks. 
<p>
<b><i>Raster to be modified (Input):</i></b><br/> Choose a raster (DEM) layer, which you want to fill gaps in.
<p>
<b><i>Filling type</i></b><br/> Choose  a filling type. If the "Interpolation type" is selected, it generates elevation data
in each empty pixel by interpolating from pixel values around it, using inverse distance weighting. Otherwise a fixed
value is filled in.

<p>
<b><i>Filling value</i></b><br/> Enter a filling value to fill the empty pixels (NoData values) with. The filling value
is applied only to the "Fixed value" filling type.
<p>If you check the box <i><b>Interpolate inside polygon(s) only</b></i>, you have to enter a <b><i>Mask layer</i></b> and the interpolation will be constrained to the mask(s) from this layer.
<p>
<b><i>Smooth resulting raster:</i></b><br/>
Checking this box will smooth the resulting raster. This means that the sharp edges will be less pronounced.<br/>
If you have checked the box <i><b>Interpolate inside polygon(s) only</b></i>, the smoothing will also be constrained to these polygons.<br>

<b><i>Smoothing type:</i></b></br>
Select a Smoothing type: Gaussian filter or Uniform filter. Please refer to the manual for details about these.
<p>
<b><i>Smoothing factor:</i></b><br/>
You may specify a smoothing factor, which represents the radius around a given pixel that will be taken into consideration. The greater the factor, the smoother will the resulting raster be.
<div>Please be aware that a higher smoothing factor will increase the processing time.</div>

<p>
<b><i>Output file path:</i></b><br/>
If there is no path specified here, the file will be created in the temporary folder. The full path will be shown in the <b>Log</b> tab and the result will be loaded to the map canvas.

<div><b>Warning:</b> Please avoid using these characters in the file name, as they might cause processing errors: <i>( ) / - % $ @ #</i><br/>
    <b>Note:</b> If this tool is used repetitively with no path specified, previous results will be overwritten. To avoid this, specify a different path (or filename) each time</div>
