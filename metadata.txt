name=Terra Antiqua
qgisMinimumVersion=3.10
description=This plugin creates digital elevation models of paleogeographic maps.
version=1.1-RC.2
author=Jovid Aminov, Diego Ruiz
email=terraantiqua.qgis@gmail.com

about=Terra Antiqua deals with the reconstruction of paleogeography, simplifying the reconstruction process. The conceptual approach we follow consists of modifying present-day topography, assuming that it is possible to infer the paleogeography based on present-day observations (e.g., fossil data, thermochronological data). Terra Antiqua provides a complete set of tools to edit Digital Elevation Models (DEM) for paleoreconstructions.
